### REASONS TO READ & LEARN OUR HISTORY...

_The past is never dead. It's not even past._ - William Faulkner  

_There's a new world, and it's in this one._ - Paul Eluard  

_So foul a sky clears not without a storm._ - William Shakespeare  

_You ought to hear and listen to what we women shall speak; for we are the owners of this land, AND IT IS OURS!_ - Seneca Women

_Or if, perchance, some dubious memorial of them should survive, it may be in the romantic dreams of the poet, to people in imagination his glades and groves, like the fauns and satyrs and sylvan deities of antiquity. But should he venture upon the dark story of their wrongs and wretchedness; should he tell how they were invaded, corrupted, despoiled, driven from their native abodes and the sepulchres of their fathers, hunted like wild beasts about the earth, and sent down with violence and butchery to the grave, posterity will either turn with horror and incredulity from the tale, or blush with indignation at the inhumanity of their forefathers.We are driven back, said an old warrior, until we can retreat no fartherour hatchets are broken, our bows are snapped, our fires are nearly extinguished:a little longer, and the white man will cease to persecute usfor we shall cease to exist!_ - Washington Irving  

_Your corn is ripe today; mine will be so tomorrow. 'Tis profit for us both, that I shou'd labour with you today, and that you shou'd aid me tomorrow. I have no kindness for you, and know you have as little for me. I will not, therefore, take any pains upon your account; and should I labour with you upon my own account, in expectation of a return, I know I shou'd in vain depend upon your gratitude. Here then I leave you to labour alone; You treat me in the same manner. The seasons change; and both of us lose our harvests for want of mutual confidence and security._ - David Hume
