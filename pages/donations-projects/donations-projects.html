            <p><strong>Please note</strong>: That as we are not a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization, your contribution is <strong>NOT</strong> tax-deductible. This said, you can be assured that any donation will be used with integrity for the development, publicity and distribution of the website and its companion products.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Sullivanclinton.com was born this year, the 225th Anniversary year of the Sullivan-Clinton Campaign. The Project is an ongoing collaboration of educators and artists, designers and you, our visitors. With your help, it will continue far beyond this year as we work to advance democratic values and mutual respect.</p>
        <p>The Sullivan/Clinton Campaign is one of the least-known, but most important events in our history. As you read, New York is hosting a few one-time commemorations that will attract tourist dollars. These help to keep its memory alive, but they're <em>nowhere</em> near enough. Because Sullivan/Clinton has been well "off the radar," we ask your help in educating visitors, teachers and students about its role in American history and its enduring impact on the Iroquois/Haudenosaunee people.</p>
        <p>While the Project's main focus is Dispossession, related topics include Sullivan/Clinton's impact on America's Westward Expansion; how it cleared the way for the Erie Canal; and how it boosted New York City's rise to world-class prominence. And, last but not least, we'll show its continuing relevance today.</p>
        <p>As <em>style</em> counts, all this will be done with a contemporary look-and-feel and with engaging multimedia and interactive approaches.</p>
        <p>In this time of severe cutbacks in Arts funding, we ask you to help develop this wonderful website as it helps to expand our awareness and our young people's education.</p>
        <p>In this time of severe cutbacks in funding for the Arts, we ask your support. Your Purchase or Donation will make a big difference. Your check, money order or <em>secure</em> PayPal donation will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Further develop this website</li>
            <li>Expand its educational outreach, and</li>
            <li>Launch the companion products described below:</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We are finalizing these exciting projects:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="index.html#book">The Book: <em>Fields of Fire</em></a>, the website's companion book.</li>
            <li><a href="index.html#mapset">The Sullivan/Clinton MapSet</a>, in 9 interactive views.</li>
            <li><a href="index.html#travel">Traveling Exhibits</a>, of 1-11 installations.</li>
            <li><a href="index.html#ed">Educational Materials</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Website/Book/ and Map are moving into high gear. Our Multi-Media Exhibit will consist of 1-10 parts (e.g., vivid photos, computer kiosks, and pop-culture objects) to show in your community. From Galleries to Libraries, Schools to Community Centers, all it takes is a Hallway, a Room or just a Corner. And with your help, our Exhibits can travel <em>anywhere</em> and be <em>duplicated</em> for showing in several places at once.</p>
