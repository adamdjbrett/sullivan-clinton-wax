[I write of] the great Loneliness which is creeping into my Soul
with every hour and every mile which separates me from you.
I really feel guilty as I applied the torch to huts that were
Homes of Content until we ravagers came spreading desolation
everywhere... Our mission here is to destroy but may it not
transpire that we pillagers are carelessly sowing the seeds of Empire?
