[War leader, Joseph Brant] is much better informed and instructed than any other Indians, he is strongly attached to the Interest of his Country of men, for which I do honor him, but he would be so Much More sensible of **the Miserable situation in which we have left this unfortunate People**, that I do believe he would do a great deal of Mischief at this Time. I do from my soul **Pity these People**, and should they Commit Outrages at giving up these Posts, it would by no means surprise me.
