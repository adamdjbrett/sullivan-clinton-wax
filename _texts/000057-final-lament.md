We are encircled, we are encompassed. The Evil Spirit rides the blast. The waters are disturbed. They rise. They press upon us and the waves settle over us. We disappear forever. Who, then, lives to mourn us? None! What marks our extermination? Nothing! We are mingled with the common elements.

Sagoyewatha (aka Red Jacket)
Seneca Chief
September 1779
