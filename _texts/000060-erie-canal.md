The Erie Canal (1825), a monumental achievement, was ultimately made possible by Washington-Sullivan-Clinton's ouster of the Iroqouis nations from the region. This grand canal was opened with a 363-mile journey across western NY, from Buffalo to Albany; then down the Hudson River to New York City. Interestingly, its lead barge was named Seneca Chief. And, its most prominent passenger was New York's Governor DeWitt Clinton - the son of General James Clinton!
