Clearly, NY's taking of millions of acres of Haudenosaunee land in 1788 was based upon the devastation of the Van Schaick April 1779 raid on Onondaga and the September Sullivan/Clinton scorched earth raids on the Cayuga and Seneca villages. New York exploited the fact that many Haudenosaunee people and some Chiefs had fled their homelands to live near the British "protection" near Ft. Niagara. The state went between the two groups and played one off against each other and they further exploited the hunger that the raid had caused.
