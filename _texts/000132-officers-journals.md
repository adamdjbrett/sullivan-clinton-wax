Arguably among the most, if not the most "journalized" expedition in military history, [Sullivan-Clinton's officers journals](http://www.usgwarchives.net/pa/1pa/1picts/sullivan/sitetoc.html) are now going online.  
A Must See: Erkuries Beatty's "forgotten" Journal on Van Schaick's destruction of Onondaga, site of the central council fire, in April of 1779, the first phase of the Campaign.
