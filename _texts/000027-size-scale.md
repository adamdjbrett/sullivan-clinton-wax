The Sullivan-Clinton Campaign was one of the largest offensive movements in the entire War of Independence. In the Spring, Van Schaick's force numbered 558, and were set against the Onandaga. By August, Sullivan and Clinton's combined troops numbered 5,100 and were launched against the Seneca and Cayuga. And to the southwest, Brodhead's units numbered 605. The total of more than 6200 soldiers, comprised roughly 1/4 of the entire Continental Army. This was the greatest number of troops ever before assembled against the Indians of North America. It was the 2nd largest expedition, after the 8.000 men used by Gen. Thomas Jesup against the Seminoles in Florida in the Second Seminole War (1835-1842).
