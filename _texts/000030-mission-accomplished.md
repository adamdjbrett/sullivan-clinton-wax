The objectives of the Sullivan Clinton Campaign were all realized. The hostile Senecas and Cayugas were terribly punished. Their homes were burned, their vast cornfields and gardens were all destroyed, and their orchards were cut down or killed.

After Sullivan-Clinton, the western bonanza could begin.
